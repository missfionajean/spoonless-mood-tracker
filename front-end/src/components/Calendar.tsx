// this will hold the logic for the calendar itself
// make sure to properly lift states so that the components can affect each other
// re-render calendar only when an update happens (put in logic to not do anything if no changes are made and submit is clicked)
// make sure there's also loading states and progress trackers (spinning wheel, progress bar, etc.) for when API calls are made
